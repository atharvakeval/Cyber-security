Nmap Summary Report – Task 1

Devices Scanned:
192.168.1.1 (probably router)
192.168.1.5 (laptop or phone)

Open Ports Found:
80 (HTTP):** Used for web interface
443 (HTTPS):** Secure web interface
22 (SSH):** Remote access – risky if enabled without firewall
53 (DNS):** Used for domain name resolution
139/445:** SMB file sharing – vulnerable if not secured

Risks:
Open SSH and SMB ports can be targets for brute-force or ransomware attacks.
HTTP (port 80) without HTTPS can expose login credentials.
It's best to disable unused services and use a firewall.

Conclusion:
This task helped me understand which devices are active on my network and how open ports can expose them to risks. I also realized that port scanning is a simple but powerful tool for both defenders and attackers.
